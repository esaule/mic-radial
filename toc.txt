Introduction: RBFs -> derivatives -> spmv -> multiple derivatives of multiple functions --> our approach
Description of previous work (obviously superficial), automatic
systems (SPARSITY, OKSY, etc.), work on GPUs
Description of MIC architecture, your work on the MIC. Perhaps other
work if there are results out there.
Description of our matrices and matrix types (supercompact, random,
compact, and realistic (based on true derivative calculation). use of
ELLPACK format.)
Description of theoretical results (measured bandwidth, measured
performance, number of floats per byte.) Plots of maximum possible
performance in best and worst cases given bandwidth results.
Description of numerical results (host version, MIC version, base
version, 4/4 version with and without RCM)
