@mastersthesis{Krog2010,
	Abstract = {{Snow is a physical phenomenon that is hard to simulate due to the wide range of
behaviors that can be found. Snow avalanches are of interest due to their complex
physical properties and because they can have a very high cost, both in terms of
economic impact and lives lost. In this thesis, we investigate the possibility of using
fluid dynamics to model snow avalanches at real-time speeds. Real-time simulations
allow for interactivity which again may accelerate the speed of development processes.
It also allows for the simulations to be used as an interactive educational tool.
Although modern GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are primarily designed to
accelerate graphics calculations in computer games, their computational power
can now also be harnessed by several other applications. This thesis builds on
our previous work on a simple Smoothing Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) fluid
dynamics model accelerated by GPUs. We extend this work by developing a more
complex SPH model and integrate these two models in our novel framework for
GPU simulations. The simple SPH model is suitable for interactive simulations
of low-viscosity Newtonian fluids, whereas our more complex SPH model includes
support for Non-Newtonian fluids through the use of rheological models. By using
a rheological model that describes the Non-Newtonian flow characteristics of snow
avalanches, we can reproduce the flowing behavior of dense flowing snow avalanches
at interactive speeds.
Our work shows that using the GPU can lead to very large performance improve-
ments that make it possible to do real-time simulations which previously required
costly specialized hardware or took minutes or hours to run. Using our highly
optimized framework, we demonstrate a large improvement in performance for the
simple model, and achieve generally very high performance for both implementations
compared to other state-of-the-art implementations. Our recent results on the new
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 470 Fermi-based card, achieves 215.4 IPS (iterations per
seconds) for 64K particles using our simple model, and 122.2 IPS and 64.9IPS for
128K and 256K particles, respectively. For the complex model, 69.6 IPS at 64K
particles, 37.4 IPS at 128K particles and 19.1 IPS at 256K particles were achieved.
Real-time simulations enabling interactivity for the simple model is achieved for up
to 256K particles, and up to 32/64K particles for the complex model.
Many other features, such as additional snow and fluid effects, could extend this
work. A list of this and other possible avenues for future work is also included.}},

	Abstract = {An hybrid technique is used for the solutions of static and time-dependent problems. The idea is to combine the radial basis function (RBF) collocation method and the pseudospectal (PS) method getting to the RBF-PS method. The approach presented in this paper includes a shape parameter optimization and produces highly accurate results. Different examples of the procedure are presented and different radial basis functions are used. One and two-dimensional problems are considered with various boundary and initial conditions. We consider generic problems, but also results on beams and plates. The displacement and the stress analysis are conducted for static and transient dynamic situations. Results obtained are in good agreement with exact solutions or references considered.},

@article{Du2006,
	Abstract = {Abstract~~Centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVT's) are special Voronoi tessellations for which the generators of the tessellation are also the centers of mass (or means) of the Voronoi cells or clusters. CVT's have been found to be useful in many disparate and diverse settings. In this paper, CVT-based algorithms are developed for image compression, image segmenation, and multichannel image restoration applications. In the image processing context and in its simplest form, the CVT-based methodology reduces to the well-known k-means clustering technique. However, by viewing the latter within the CVT context, very useful generalizations and improvements can be easily made. Several such generalizations are exploited in this paper including the incorporation of cluster dependent weights, the incorporation of averaging techniques to treat noisy images, extensions to treat multichannel data, and combinations of the aforementioned. In each case, examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness of CVT-based image processing methodologies. },

	Abstract = {We present a graphics hardware implementation of the tangent-plane algorithm for computing the kth-order Voronoi diagram of a set of point sites in image space. Correct and efficient implementation of this algorithm using graphics hardware is possible only with the use of an appropriate shader program on the GPU. This is achieved by rendering in k passes the parallel projection of the top k levels of an arrangement of planes tangent to the paraboloid z = x2+y2. Each level of the arrangement corresponds to the so-called kth-nearest point diagram, which is interesting in its own right. Composition of the images of the k top levels results in the kth-order Voronoi diagram. The diagram facilitates efficient computation of the k nearest neighbors of an arbitrary query point. We describe our implementation of the algorithm in OpenGL and Cg, and several optimizations. We also show how to efficiently compute the distance transform of the given sites using the GPU, based on the first-order Voronoi diagram.},

The process involves evaluation of the methods in terms of timing, storage, accuracy, visual pleasantness of the surface, and ease of implementation. To indicate the flavor of the type of results obtained, we give a summary table and representative perspective plots of several surfaces.},

	Abstract = {Centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) are Voronoi tessellations
	of a region such that the generating points of the tessellations
	are also the centroids of the corresponding Voronoi cells. In this
	paper, some probabilistic methods for determining CVTs and their
	parallel implementations on distributed memory systems are presented.
	By using multi-sampling in a new probabilistic algorithm we introduce,
	more accurate and efficient approximations of CVTs are obtained without
	the need to explicit construct Voronoi diagrams. The new algorithm
	lends itself well to parallelization, i.e., near prefect linear speed
	up in the number of processors is achieved. The results of computational
	experiments performed on a CRAY T3E600 system are provided which
	illustrate the superior sequential and parallel performance of the
	new algorithm when compared to existing algorithms. In particular,
	for the same amount of work, the new algorithms produce significantly
	more accurate CVTs.},

@article{Namekar2009,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the use of neural network to model nonlinear tsunami processes for forecasting of coastal waveforms and runup. The three‐layer network utilizes a radial basis function in the hidden, middle layer for nonlinear transformation of input waveforms near the tsunami source. Events based on the 2006 Kuril Islands tsunami demonstrate the implementation and capability of the network. Division of the Kamchatka‐Kuril subduction zone into a number of subfaults facilitates development of a representative tsunami dataset using a nonlinear long‐wave model. The computed waveforms near the tsunami source serve as the input and the far‐field waveforms and runup provide the target output for training of the network through a back‐propagation algorithm. The trained network reproduces the resonance of tsunami waves and the topography‐dominated runup patterns at Hawaii's coastlines from input water‐level data off the Aleutian Islands.},

	Abstract = {The rapid increase in the performance of graphics hardware, coupled with recent improvements in its programmability, have made graphics hardware a compelling platform for computationally demanding tasks in a wide variety of application domains. In this report, we describe, summarize, and analyze the latest research in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware.},

@inproceedings{Stuart2009,
	Abstract = {This paper explores the challenges in implementing a message passing interface usable on systems with data-parallel processors. As a case study, we design and implement the \"DCGN\" API on NVIDIA GPUs that is similar to MPI and allows full access to the underlying architecture. We introduce the notion of data-parallel thread-groups as a way to map resources to MPI ranks. We use a method that also allows the data-parallel processors to run autonomously from user-written CPU code. In order to facilitate communication, we use a sleep-based polling system to store and retrieve messages. Unlike previous systems, our method provides both performance and flexibility. By running a test suite of applications with different communication requirements, we find that a tolerable amount of overhead is incurred, somewhere between one and five percent depending on the application, and indicate the locations where this overhead accumulates. We conclude that with innovations in chipsets and drivers, this overhead will be mitigated and provide similar performance to typical CPU-based MPI implementations while providing fully-dynamic communication.},

@article{Wang2002,
	Abstract = {A point interpolation meshless method is proposed based on combining radial and polynomial basis functions. Involvement of radial basis functions overcomes possible singularity associated with the meshless methods based on only the polynomial basis. This non-singularity is useful in constructing well-performed shape functions. Furthermore, the interpolation function obtained passes through all scattered points in an influence domain and thus shape functions are of delta function property. This makes the implementation of essential boundary conditions much easier than the meshless methods based on the moving least-squares approximation. In addition, the partial derivatives of shape functions are easily obtained, thus improving computational efficiency. Examples on curve=surface fittings and solid mechanics problems show that the accuracy and convergence rate of the present method is high},

Although graphics hardware is a good tool for making such images, its drawing speed is not so high as we expect when we draw it only using naive algorithms. This paper describes a technique for accelerating the drawing speed by reducing some polygons we do not need to draw. We focus on the algorithm for normal two-dimensional Euclidean Voronoi diagrams and segment Voronoi diagrams.},

@article{Yokota2010,
	Abstract = {We have developed a parallel algorithm for radial basis function (RBF) interpolation that exhibits O(N) complexity,requires O(N) storage, and scales excellently up to a thousand processes. The algorithm uses a GMRES iterative solver with a restricted additive Schwarz method (RASM) as a preconditioner and a fast matrix-vector algorithm. Previous fast RBF methods, --,achieving at most O(NlogN) complexity,--, were developed using multiquadric and polyharmonic basis functions. In contrast, the present method uses Gaussians with a small variance (a common choice in particle methods for fluid simulation, our main target application). The fast decay of the Gaussian basis function allows rapid convergence of the iterative solver even when the subdomains in the RASM are very small. The present method was implemented in parallel using the PETSc library (developer version). Numerical experiments demonstrate its capability in problems of RBF interpolation with more than 50 million data points, timing at 106 seconds (19 iterations for an error tolerance of 10\^{}-15 on 1024 processors of a Blue Gene/L (700 MHz PowerPC processors). The parallel code is freely available in the open-source model.},

If we wish to exploit zeros in the band of A which occur before the first nonzero in each row and column, it has been experimentally observed that reversing the ordering produced by the Cuthill-McKee algorithm is often very much better than the original ordering in terms of the amount of storage and work required to factor A. We prove that for band elimination methods, the two orderings are equivalent and that, surprisingly, the reverse ordering is always at least as good as the original one when envelope elimination techniques are used. We give a condition on the matrix A under which the reverse ordering is strictly better than the original one, and we include several numerical experiments and analyses of practical examples to illustrate our results.},
