Review 1

The cost of computing the derivatives requires the inversion of a nxn system of equations for each node. For stencil sizes of 64 or 128, 
this can be expensive. But the calculation of derivative weights is done only once. Our method is useful when solving time-dependent PDEs or stationary PDEs via iterative methods, and the derivatives are to be computed thousands if not millions of times, thus amortizing the original cost. 

Effectively, we could go to n_m=n_v to 16 based on figure 3. However, as mentionned in the introduction, the transport equations for 
Euler's equations require $x,y,z$ derivatives of $u,v,w,p$ and the calculation of a special hyperviscosity operator. Thus, there are four derivatives applied to four functions. If we had more functions and more derivatives, we could certainly increase the values of n_m and n_v. 

We use 1D arrays for all operations. If the data is contiguous, a 1D array is equivalent to a 2D array, with our own control of pointers. 
Low level programming, assembler, CUDA, etc. all work better with 1D arrays. Finally, we would like have a certain degree of 
control of where our data goes in memory, and thus it is easier to think about our arrays as one-dimensional. 

Given the short space provided, we were only brief in our description of the RBF-FD, and the implementation on the MIC, although we
provided source code for those interested in the details. 
The stencil size is the number of non-zeros in each row of the matrix $A$ used in the matrix multiplication y = A*x.   Equation (1) in the paper represents the product y = A x, where y is the computed derivative, A is the derivative matrix, and x is the function whose derivative is being computed.
