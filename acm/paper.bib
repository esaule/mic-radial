Title = {Performance Modeling and Analysis of Cache Blocking in Sparse Matrix Vector Multiply},
Institution = {EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley},

URL = {http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2004/5535.html},

Abstract = {We consider the problem of building high-performance implementations of sparse matrix-vector multiply (SpM x V), or <i>y</i> = <i>y</i> + <i>A</i> * x, which is an important and ubiquitous computational kernel. Prior work indicates that cache blocking of SpM x V is extremely important for some matrix and machine combinations, with speedups as high as 3x. In this paper we present a new, more compact data structure for cache blocking for SpM x V and look at the general question of when and why performance improves. Cache blocking appears to be most effective when simultaneously 1) the vector <i>x</i> does not fit in cache 2) the vector <i>y</i> fits in cache 3) the non zeros are distributed throughout the matrix and 4) the non zero density is sufficiently high. In particular we find that cache blocking does not help with band matrices no matter how large <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are since the matrix structure already lends itself to the optimal access pattern. <p>Prior work on performance modeling assumed that the matrices were small enough so that <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> fit in the cache. However when this is not the case, the optimal block sizes picked by these models may have poor performance motivating us to update these performance models. In contrast, the optimum block sizes predicted by the new performance models generally match the measured optimum block sizes and therefore the models can be used as a basis for a heuristic to pick the block size. <p>We conclude with architectural suggestions that would make processor and memory systems more amenable to SpM x V.}

                  graphs. It basically rely on eigen vector extraction
                  to draw graphs. They show a model which minimizes
                  the pair wise distance of the vertices which shares
                  an edge while trying to maximize the drawing
                  area. The drawing is normalized by enforcing
                  constraint on the variance of each dimension and
                  their covariance. This has a lot of good property
                  like dimensional scale invariance and orthogonalite
                  of the vectors position in each dimension. In other
                  words, a project of a 3d plot is the optimal 2d
                  plot.\\They show that this model is equivalent to
                  the extraction of the eigen vector of the laplacian
                  of the adjacency matrix of the graph.\\They also
                  show the same formulation is equivalent to placing
                  each vertex at the centroid of its neighboors.\\This
                  paper is heavy on linear algebra but quite
